      <h2>Summer</h2>
      <p>
        Summer is the warmest season of the year, occurring between spring and
        autumn. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is usually defined as the period
        between the summer solstice (year’s longest day), June 21 or 22, and the
        autumnal equinox (day and night equal in length), September 22 or 23;
        and in the Southern Hemisphere, as the period between December 22 or 23
        and March 20 or 21.<br /><br />
      </p>

      <h2>Summer weather</h2>
      <p>
        Summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather. In
        Mediterranean climates, it is also associated with dry weather, while in
        other places (particularly in Eastern Asia because of the monsoon) it is
        associated with rainy weather. In some areas, the heat translates to
        drier temperatures. This hot, dry time of year can lead to droughts,
        where water is in short supply. Heat waves, times of excessively hot
        weather that include spikes in temperature, can also occur during the
        summer.<br /><br />
      </p>
